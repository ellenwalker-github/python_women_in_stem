    "## Follow-Up Activities\n",
    "1. Go to your local library and see if they have books on women in STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics). Look for a nonfiction book, a biography. What did she study in school? Write a short report on the book and share it with your science, programming, math or language class. Draw a picture of her to go with your report. \n",
    "2. Add quotes by the women to these Python dictionaries, at the end of their dictionary. You have an example in some of the dictionaries, but not all. See if you can find quotes online or at your library.\n",
    "3. What is one of the roles that sounded interesting to you? Was there a role you had not heard of before? Was there a word that you had never heard before that sounded interesting? Go the library and find out more about one of the careers or subjects that sparks your curiosity. Write about it and share it with one of your classes at school.\n",
    "4. Who are some women in STEM in your town? Ask your local librarian. Find some women working as teachers, in medicine, in technology, or working in mathematics. Maybe they are working in finance or accounting. Do you know any? Ask them some questions, like what they like about their jobs or how they got started in their field.\n",
    "5. Use the Women in STEM dictionaries to make a quiz, working in pairs.\n",
    "6. What is one of the professional associations to which a famous woman in STEM belonged or belongs? Look at their Wikipedia pages to find one, and then find out more about it."
